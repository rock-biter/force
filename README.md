# FORCE

A GPU-first physics engine for the web, built on [WebGPU](https://www.w3.org/TR/webgpu/).

> **Status: early development.** FORCE is being built in the open, one step at a time, and
> studying how physics engines work is part of the job. The package is not published on npm, and
> the API will change without notice.

## Where we are

*Updated November 11, 2026*

**Latest step:** [the ground](./docs/logbook/010-the-ground.md). Particles no longer fall
forever: they bounce on a flat ground, slide and stop. A first, simple version; real contacts will
come with the rigid bodies. Just before it, [the first picture](./docs/logbook/009-the-first-picture.md):
a debug viewer on three.js that draws the particles straight from the engine's GPU memory.

**Next:** back to the WebGPU guides, starting with buffers. Sharing one buffer between FORCE and
three.js gets a guide of its own.

Every step, with what we learned and what went wrong, is in the [logbook](./docs/README.md).

## Goals

- Run the simulation on the GPU with WebGPU compute shaders.
- Stay independent of any rendering library.
- Add a WebGL fallback later on.

## Requirements

A [browser with WebGPU support](https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/wiki/Implementation-Status),
on a page served from HTTPS or localhost.

The WebGPU types are built into TypeScript 6 and later. On TypeScript 5, also install
[`@webgpu/types`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webgpu/types).

## Usage

```js
import { World } from 'force-gpu'

// x, y, z for each particle, in meters
const positions = new Float32Array([0, 10, 0, 1, 12, 0])
const world = await World.create({ device, positions })

function frame(frameTime) {
  // seconds since the last frame: the engine runs as many fixed steps as they hold
  world.update(frameTime)
}
```

**Give FORCE your renderer's GPU device.** A buffer created on one device cannot be used on
another, so if FORCE and your renderer each had their own, every position would have to travel
through the CPU between them. When no `device` is given, FORCE requests one of its own: fine for a
page that only simulates. Examples with three.js and other libraries will follow.
